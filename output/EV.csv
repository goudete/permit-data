South of Golden Gate Park, the Project site is located in the Inner Sunset District, a highly urbanized area with surrounding uses including residential, commercial and park. The Project site is currently zoned for RH-2: Residential -Two Family and is being used as an automotive repair shop. It is located at the corner of Kirkham St and 19th Ave with two existing buildings located along the east boarder of the site, approximately 1,500 square ft in total. Through a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) the Project would develop EV charging stations and demolish the existing buildings on the Project site.

Overall the site includes fourteen EV charging stalls, 10 of which are Fleet EV charging stalls and separated by a sliding gate and fence. Thus dividing the north end of the site to public use and the south end to Fleet use. The charging stalls are located on the east and west boarders of the site with a (width) two direction road going north and south down the center of the site.

The Project includes one access point, a 24ft wide driveway, on the north/public end of the site off of Kirkham St. On the north end of the east boarder of the public side of the site, and moving south, there would be one EV charging stall, a Delta 350 kilowatt (KW) charge dispenser, another EV charging stall, a 350 KW power cabinet, and a fence diving off the public access area. Starting at the north end and moving south, on the west boarder of the public side is a delta 100 KW city charger, two public EV charging stalls, another delta 100 KW city charger, and a fence diving the north (public) and south (fleet) sides of the Project.

The fencing and motorized sliding gate run parallel to Kirkham St. and designated (SQ) to public use, and (SQ) to fleet use. Following the fencing, on the east boarder of the fleet side of the site, and moving south is a utility transformer, switchgear, one fleet charging stall, a delta 200 KW charge dispenser, another two fleet charging stalls, another delta 200 KW charge dispenser, and a final fleet charging stall.

South of Golden Gate Park, the Project site is located in the Outer Sunset District, a highly urbanized area with surrounding uses including residential, commercial and park. 

The existing site is being utilized as an automotive garage and is zoned for RH-2: Residential -Two Family. Through a Conditional Use Authorization (CUA) the Project would develop an EV charging station. The Project is located at the corner of Irving St and 40th Ave with one existing building, approximately (sf) located along the south boarder of the site. 

The Project includes 3 curb cuts, one on the west boarder of the project site, on 40th Ave (near) the corner, and two on the northern boarder off of Irving St. The Project would also add fencing on the north and west sides of the Project, which face the street. There would be two access points to the site, one located on 40th Ave with a 23 ft rolling gate, and the other on Irving St, located on the eastern end of the site, also with a 18ft 4 in rolling gate. The Project will not remove any of the existing 1,020 sf structure. The structure would be reused to provide enclosed EV charging stations.

Overall the site would include fourteen 14 EV charging stalls, all 9 ft wide and X ft long , seven (7) Delta 100 kilowatt (KW) city chargers, one switchgear and one utility transformer both located in the southeast corner of the site. Eight (8) EV charging stalls would line the northern boarder of the site, with four (4) Delta 100KW city chargers between every other stall. Four (4) EV charging stalls would be located at the west end of the southern boarder of the site, with two (2) delta chargers between every other stall.
