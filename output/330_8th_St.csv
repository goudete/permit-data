The property is occupied by a 3-story  building approximately 22,480 sq. ft. in size. Each floor has separate street access and the building contains two garage openings on the 8th St. frontage which allows access to the main and basement floors. There is a second limited opening from Ringold St. 

The project proposes to convert the existing Automotive Use to an EV Fleet Charging Facility under new zoning legislation adopted by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. This will allow establishment of a ride-hailing service using electric autonomous vehicles. 

The conversion of the project site includes the addition of electric charging infrastructure and other interior alterations to allow for an EV charging and storage facility for future tenants to lease. The future tenant will use the property to provide taxi/ride-hailing services to residents, visitors and businesses within the nearby neighborhoods and will also require authorization from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The interior will be remodeled to include 16 charging stations and a service area for a maximum of 32 light-duty vehicles. The exterior of the building will not be altered or changed and will be cleaned and preserved ""in-kind.""

The Project Site is located within the WMUG WSoMa Mixed Use General zoning district.
